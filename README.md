In this task, I performed a data analysis using SQL aggregation queries on a dataset named online_sales_data. The dataset includes various fields like Date, Product Category, Units Sold, Total Revenue, Region, Product Name, and Payment Method.

I created and executed multiple SQL queries to analyze business performance and extract useful insights. Here's what I did:

1)Monthly Revenue Trend Analysis:

Aggregated revenue data by year and month to visualize how sales trends change over time.

2)Top Product Categories by Revenue:

Used SUM() and GROUP BY to identify which product categories generated the most revenue.

3)Top-Selling Products:

Retrieved the top 10 products based on the total number of units sold.

4)Regional Revenue Comparison:

Compared revenue across different regions to find the most profitable ones.

5)Payment Method Insights:

Counted total transactions and calculated revenue per payment method to understand customer preferences.

6)Daily Sales Report:

Tracked daily revenue to help with time-series analysis and detect peak or low-performing days.

7)Average Order Value per Category:

Calculated average revenue per product category to analyze pricing efficiency.

8)Monthly Revenue and Order Volume:

Combined revenue and order volume data for each month to provide a holistic view of sales performance.

These queries helped in understanding trends, customer behavior, and regional and product-wise performance, which are critical for making business decisions.
